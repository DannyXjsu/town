# Town - Urbex
Urban exploration game

## Movement
Based on Quake's movement, slightly tweaked

## Shaders
I've custom built the surface/spatial shaders, surfaces are inspired by Source Engine's surfaces.

I use the Lambertian Wrap diffusion method. Surfaces use a simple base color multiplied by a texture and a normal map, with triplanar option copied from Godot's.
